Mental Health and Stress Analysis for Students is an AI-powered web application designed to predict a student’s stress level and classify them into behavioral clusters using machine learning techniques. The system collects key lifestyle and psychological inputs such as sleep duration, study hours, exercise frequency, anxiety and depression levels, focus ability, and diet score, which are preprocessed using normalization before being passed into two models — Random Forest (supervised) for stress prediction and K-Means clustering (unsupervised) for grouping similar student profiles. Built using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application displays interactive results, including stress category (Low/Medium/High), cluster group, model accuracy, and analytical visualizations like confusion matrix, feature importance, and PCA cluster plots. This project aims to serve as an early awareness and decision-support tool for students, educational institutions, counselors, and researchers focused on improving mental well-being through data-driven insights.Mental Health and Stress Analysis for Students is an AI-powered web application designed to predict a student’s stress level and classify them into behavioral clusters using machine learning techniques.
